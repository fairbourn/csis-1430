<h2> Short Essay</h2>
<p>
  For this project, I decided to go with something that I have enjoyed my whole life. That being Star Wars Legos. This is a set I have wanted since I was about 7 years old (I now own it). But when I originally came up with this idea for this project I thought it would be really cool to break each section up and add a link to that corresponding scene. But I had to use various websites to fit instead.
For the first part I did which was the squares, I decided to add some informative sites. Places where you could read about the lore and whatnot. So I chose for the user to click on C-3P0, R2-D2, and Darth Vader to give that information.
The second part I did was the circles. This was kind of my miscellaneous sites part. For example, when you click on the Han Solo Minifigure you get directed to Harrison Ford’s IMDB page. If you click on Moff Tarkin you get directed to where you can buy this set. And for the two Stormtrooper, I included a link to the scene where a Stromtrooper actually hits his head in the movie!
And the last part was the polygons. This is the part where I had the most fun. I wanted to do something with the Death Star’s laser so I made it open up a link that lets you explore the Star War’s galaxy! I wanted it to seem like you could choose a planet to blow up with the Death Star’s laser! Then I made the trash compacter part of the set a link to that specific scene. Lastly, I found a site where you can build your own lightsaber so I thought who better to click on than Obi-Wan to direct you to where you can build your very own lightsaber!
